# GitHub Fetcher

This is a app for fetching and displaying your GitHub repos.

To run it you just need to clone the repo on your local machine and then:
( you also need node and docker installed)
- Add your `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` to the back end .env file.
- Do the same for the `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- Run the `docker-compose up --build ` command.
